We've all experienced the frustration of tossing and turning in bed, unable to
fall asleep. But what if we told you that ambient noise could be the key to a
good night's sleep?

Research has shown that ambient noise improves sleep quality and increases sleep
duration. In this post, we'll dive into the benefits of ambient noise and how
you can use it to improve your sleep.

## Why can ambient noise improve your sleep?

Ambient noise is defined as any sound that surrounds us, whether it's the hum of
a city or the chirping of crickets. It can help mask disruptive sounds and
create a sense of tranquillity, leading to improved sleep quality and duration.

One of the main reasons ambient noise can improve sleep is by reducing stress
levels. Noise-induced stress can interfere with our ability to fall asleep and
stay asleep. Ambient noise, on the other hand, can help create a relaxing
environment that lowers cortisol levels and promotes a sense of calm.

In addition to reducing stress, ambient noise can also stimulate the production
of serotonin and melatonin, hormones that regulate sleep. It can help you fall
asleep faster and stay asleep longer.

Establishing a bedtime routine with ambient noise can help create an association
between feelings of drowsiness and your sleep surroundings. Hearing the same
ambient noises each night can cue your body and mind to wind down and prepare
for sleep. Whether it's white noise, nature sounds, or calming music, finding
the right ambient noises to incorporate into your bedtime routine can make a
world of difference in your sleep experience.

## How can you use ambient noise for better sleep?

Now that you understand the science behind the benefits of ambient noise, it's
time to start using it to improve your sleep. Here are some tips to get you
started:

1. **Experiment with different types of ambient noise**: There are countless
   types of ambient noise to choose from, including white noise, pink noise, and
   nature sounds. Experiment with different ambient noises to find what works
   best for you.

2. **Keep the volume low**: Ambient noise should be just loud enough to mask
   disruptive sounds but not so loud that it becomes disruptive itself. Aim for
   a volume that's between 40-60 decibels.

3. **Use ambient noise in conjunction with other sleep-promoting habits**:
   Ambient noise is just one of many tools you can use to improve sleep. It's
   most effective when aided with other sleep-promoting habits, such as
   practising good sleep hygiene and avoiding screens before bedtime.

In conclusion, incorporating ambient noise into your sleep routine can transform
the quality and length of your slumber. With its stress-reducing abilities,
hormone-stimulating effects, and disruptive sound-masking properties, ambient
noise can be the missing piece to your sleep puzzle. It can help you fall asleep
faster and stay asleep longer. So, why not try it and see if it works for you?
Your body and mind will thank you!
