Meditation has become an accessible practice in recent years, with people
discovering its benefits for mental and emotional well-being. However, some
people find it difficult to quiet their minds and focus on their breathing,
especially in the beginning. It is where ambient noise can come in handy.

Ambient noise is any sound that provides a background or fills the space around
you. In this context, it is a tool to enhance your meditation practice. The idea
is to choose a sound that is both calming and engaging, so you can stay focused
on your breath while being fully present in the current moment.

## Getting Started

To get started, get into your meditation position. Sit or lie down comfortably,
and focus on your breathing. Concentrating on your breath is a crucial aspect of
meditation. It helps to quiet the mind and bring awareness to the present
moment. By paying attention to the sensation of air moving in and out of your
body, you can cultivate a sense of peace and tranquillity in your mind and body.

## Be Kind to Yourself

Focusing on your breath is a core component of mindfulness meditation. It's
natural for your mind to wander during meditation. The key to redirecting your
focus back to your breath is to be gentle and non-judgmental with yourself.
Remember to be kind to yourself! You can also count every inhale and exhale or
visualise your breath as a wave to help bring your focus back to your breath.
With practice, you'll be able to easily nudge your concentration back to your
breath more quickly and easily.

Another significant aspect to remember is setting a time limit for your
meditation. A good starting point could be anywhere from 5-15 minutes, depending
on your preference and schedule. However, it's important not to force yourself
into a predetermined time frame. Let your meditation practice develop
organically.

## Enhance Your Practice with Ambient Noise

However, focusing on your breath during meditation can be challenging,
especially when your mind is full of distracting thoughts. One way to help
combat this is by using ambient noise to help focus your attention. Ambient
noise can provide a background distraction that can help quiet the mind and keep
you present in the current moment. It is vital to choose an ambient noise that
suits your needs.

Some people find that natural sounds, such as gentle rain or ocean waves, help
to calm the mind and reduce stress. Others find that white noise, such as the
sound of a fan or air conditioner, provides a neutral background that helps to
block out other distractions. Experiment with different types of ambient noise
to find the one that works best for you. Each sound can evoke a different mood
or emotion and help you get into a deeper meditative state.

It's important to remember that mindfulness meditation with ambient noise is
just one of many different approaches to meditation. It doesn't work for
everyone, and many other techniques can be just as effective. However, if you're
looking to get started with meditation or have trouble quieting your mind,
incorporating ambient noise into your practice can help you stay focused and
present. It may be a valuable addition to your meditation, even if you are an
experienced practitioner. So, why not try it and see how it works for you?
