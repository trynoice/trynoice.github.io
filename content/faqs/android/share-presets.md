You can share your saved presets with your friends as plain HTTP URLs. These
URLs are self-contained and can work without the Internet. To share a preset
with friends, you can follow the steps below.

1. Navigate to the **Presets** tab from the bottom bar.
2. Find the preset you want to play and open its context menu by clicking the
   inverted triangle button.
3. Select the **Share** option from the context menu.
4. Use the **Share** system modal to share the generated URL of the preset.
