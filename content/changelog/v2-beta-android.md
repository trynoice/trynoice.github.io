It is the first beta release of Noice v2 following the [announcement last
September](/news/v2-announcement). Please consider providing us with your
valuable feedback so that we can improve the overall user experience. If you
face any issues, please report them to us immediately at
[trynoiceapp@gmail.com](mailto:trynoiceapp@gmail.com).

## What's New

- The new sound engine adds natural variations to sounds _(available to
  subscribers only)_.
- Sounds are now much longer than earlier versions.
- We now host the sound library on the Internet. It has significantly decreased
  the APK size. The Android app caches sound on the first playback to reduce
  data usage. But you'll need an Internet connection for playback.
- You can stream sounds at up to 320 kbps. Previously, the maximum audio quality
  was 128 kbps.
- You can now configure sound fade-in and fade-out durations individually for up
  to 30 seconds.

> The **presets from older versions will be lost on upgrading** to v2. Preset
> URLs shared using older versions will also stop working.

> We're still working on the Chromecast support for this release. **On
> upgrading, you'll lose the ability to cast audio from Noice to Chromecast
> devices** until the coming few releases.

> We're still working on our **Terms of Service** and **Privacy Policy**. Please
> bear with us as we sort through them.

> If you wish to downgrade to v1 after trying v2, please download a relevant APK
> from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/trynoice/android-app/releases). The
> `full` APK has non-free Google dependencies, while the `free` variant only
> uses FOSS dependencies.

## Coming soon

- Offline playback (_for subscribers_).
- Chromecast support.
