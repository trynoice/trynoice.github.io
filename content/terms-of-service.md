## Terms of Service for Noice Premium

Noice Premium and are available for purchase on a subscription basis.

By purchasing Noice Premium, you agree to authorize recurring payments as
specified by the selected plan. These payments will be made to us using the
selected payment method until you or we cancel the subscription. We use
third-party services to process all payments securely. You can manage your Noice
Premium subscription in the account section of the app(s).

### Payments

  must update your payment method before the grace period ends to keep your
  subscription active.
- Payment providers may apply their conversion rates to transactions in
  different currencies.
- In certain regions, you may need to pay additional local taxes, added to the
  total cost of purchase.

### Cancellation and Refunds

- You can cancel your Noice Premium subscription at any time. But, your
  subscription will remain active from the time of cancellation until the end of
  the current billing period.
- We do not issue refunds or credits for the remaining duration of your current
  billing period upon cancellation.
- You will lose access to all features associated with Noice Premium only when
  your subscription ends.

  delivering services. We will not compensate you for any loss resulting from
  our temporary inability to provide our services. We report operational
  incidents on our [service status portal](https://status.trynoice.com).
