This Privacy Policy describes how **Noice: Natural calming noise** (Noice, "we",
"us", or "our") collects, stores and uses the data that you provide or we
generate. This policy is part of our terms of service.

## Personal Data

Noice asks for or collects the following personal data from its users.

### Basic Account Data

We ask you for a screen name and email address upon signing up. We use this data
to identify and communicate with you. We also use your screen name to help you
identify the currently signed-in Noice account on an app.

> We do not require you to use your real name as your screen name.

### User Agent and IP Address

Noice collects your user agent and IP address in server access logs.
Additionally, we associate your user agent to a session token when you sign in
to a Noice account.

> We periodically purge all log entries older than 30 days and expired session
> tokens from our servers.

On the Noice Android app, the constructed user-agent string looks like `Noice/2.2.1
(Android 11; Xiaomi Mi A3) OkHttp/4.10.0`, where:

- `2.2.1` is the Noice Android app version
- `11` is your Android version
- `Xiaomi` is your device manufacturer
- `Mi A3` is your device model
- `4.10.0` is the OkHttp version that the Noice app is using

## Subscriptions and Payments Data

We support Google Play In-App and Stripe billing for purchasing Noice Premium.
These third parties retain all of your subscription billing data on our behalf.

### Google Play In-App Billing

Google Play In-App Billing users should refer to the [Privacy Policy of Google
Play](https://policies.google.com/privacy) on billing and payments.

### Stripe

Stripe Billing users should refer to the [Privacy Policy of
Stripe](https://stripe.com/privacy). Please note that we share your email
address with Stripe when using Stripe Billing.

> We publish two variants of our Android app, Free and Full. The Free variant
> uses FOSS dependencies and relies on Stripe billing for subscriptions, while
> the Full variant uses non-free dependencies and relies on Google Play In-App
> Billing. We publish the Free variant on
> [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/app/com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice) and the Full
> variant on [Google
> Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice).

## Android App Performance Data

The Android app collects app usage and behaviour data. [Firebase Analytics and
Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products-engage) services collect,
store and process this data on our behalf. All collected performance data is
anonymous, and we never associate it with your personal data.

> The Android app only collects this performance data when the user explicitly
> consents to it. The app displays the consent notice on its first launch. Users
> can manage their consent preference by navigating to **Account > Settings >
> Others > Share usage and behaviour data** in the app. The performance data
> collection is not available on the Free app variant.

### Usage Data

During Android app usage, Noice collects data on app interactions performed by
the user. Usage data includes time spent in the app, features used and other
metrics.

### Behaviour Data

In case of an unexpected error in the Android app, Noice collects app behaviour
data from your device. Behaviour data includes information such as your device
name, operating system version, the configuration of the app, the time and date
of its use, and generated debug messages.

## Deleting Your Data

You can delete your Noice account and associated data by going to the account
section of the app(s). However, we retain your data for up to 14 days on our
servers post account deletion, and the following exceptions apply.

- We do not delete the Stripe billing data associated with your email address.
- We do not immediately delete your IP address and user agent from our server
  access logs. We purge these access logs on their regular timelines.
- We do not delete the Android App Performance Data since we can not identify
  what belongs to you.

## Third-party service providers

Noice employs various third-party services, like Stripe, to collect, store and
process data on our behalf for purposes relevant to us. However, these services
are obligated not to disclose or use this data for other purposes.

## Security

We value your trust in us to keep the collected data safe. Thus, we are striving
to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. Since no method of
transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely
secure and reliable, we do not guarantee its absolute security.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this policy occasionally. We advise you to review this page
periodically for changes. We will also maintain a summary of changes in this
section.
