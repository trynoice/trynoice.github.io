This Privacy Policy describes how **Noice: Natural calming noise** (Noice, "we",
"us", or "our") collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected
from its users. The policy applies to all of our users and the services we
provide. Our commitment to protecting user privacy is at the forefront of our
operations, and we strive to ensure that all data is collected and used as
described by this policy. By using Noice, you agree to the collection and use of
this information as per this policy.

## What data do we collect, and how do we use it

### Basic Account Data

We ask you for a screen name and email address upon signing up. We use this data
to identify and authenticate you and communicate with you. Please note that we
do not require you to use your real name as your screen name.

Upon signing up or in, we generate session tokens on our servers and store them
on your device. We use these tokens to authenticate you without asking you to
establish your identity again. When you're using the Noice Android app, we
securely store these tokens in the app's private storage. We associate your
user-agent string with session tokens before storing them on our servers. These
tokens automatically expire 14 days after their last usage, and we periodically
purge expired tokens from our servers.

> Browsers ship with a self-identifying user-agent string, e.g. `Mozilla/5.0
> (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0`. On the
> Noice Android app, we construct your user-agent string using the Noice Android
> app and your Android version, device model and manufacturer, and the OkHttp
> version, e.g. `Noice/2.4.2 (Android 11; Xiaomi Mi A3) OkHttp/4.10.0`.

### Subscription and Payment Data

When you subscribe to Noice Premium, we process your payments through [Google
Play In-App
Purchases](https://play.google.com/console/about/in-appproductssetup/) or
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) billing. These third parties retain and handle
your subscription and payment data on our behalf.

Users of **Google Play In-App Purchases** should refer to the [Privacy Policy of
Google Play](https://policies.google.com/privacy) on billing and payments.

Users of **Stripe** should refer to the [Privacy Policy of
Stripe](https://stripe.com/privacy). Please note that we share your email
address with Stripe when you use Stripe Billing for subscriptions.

We collect and process specific data that these services share with us, such as
your plan type and price, subscription start date, billing cycle and payment
status. We use this information to grant you access to Noice Premium and display
a billing dashboard in our app.

> We publish two variants of our Android app, Free and Full. The Free variant
> builds on free and open-source software and relies on Stripe Billing for
> subscriptions. The Full variant additionally includes proprietary software and
> uses Google Play In-App Purchases. We publish the Free variant on
> [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/app/com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice) and the Full
> variant on [Google
> Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice).

### Software Usage, Performance and Behaviour Data

When you use our software and services, we collect and process its usage,
performance and behaviour data, but only with your explicit consent. We display
consent notices in our software on the first launch asking for your approval.
[Firebase Analytics and
Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products-engage), and [Google
Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) services
collect and process this data on our behalf. We do not share this information
with third parties except when required by the law.

To keep this data anonymised, we generate and store a random token on your
device. We use this token to aggregate your data, and we never associate this
token or this data with your personal information. On the browser, we store this
token using cookies, and on the Android app, we use the app's private storage.

**Usage Data** includes your anonymised IP address to understand our general
demography. It also contains the time you spent using the software, your user
agent and your interactions within the software. We use these metrics to
understand how we can make our software more efficient for you.

**Performance and Behaviour Data** includes information such as your device
name, operating system version, the configuration of the app, the time and date
of its use, and generated error messages. We use this information to diagnose
and resolve technical issues and improve the performance and stability of the
software.

> The Free Android app variant is incapable of collecting software usage,
> performance and behaviour data and thus doesn't show a consent message on its
> first launch.

### Server Access and Error Logs

We collect your IP address and user agent in our server access and error logs.
We use this information to provide a secure and efficient service, prevent fraud
and abuse, and diagnose technical issues. We periodically purge all log entries
older than 30 days.

## Deleting Your Data

You can delete your Noice account and its associated data by going to the
account section of the app. However, we retain your data for up to 14 days on
our servers after account deletion, and the following exceptions apply.

- We permanently retain your Noice Premium purchase history and billing data.
  However, we strip your personal information from this data.
- We do not delete the anonymised software usage, performance and behaviour data
  generated by you.
- We do not immediately delete your data from our server access and error logs.
  We purge these logs on their regular timelines.

## Third-party Service Providers

Noice employs various third-party services, like Stripe, to collect and process
data on our behalf for purposes relevant to us. However, these services are
obligated not to disclose or use this data for other purposes.

## Security

We value your trust in us to keep your data safe. Thus, we are striving to use
commercially acceptable means of protecting it. Since no method of transmission
over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure and
reliable, we do not guarantee its absolute security.

periodically for changes. We will also maintain a summary of changes in this
section.
